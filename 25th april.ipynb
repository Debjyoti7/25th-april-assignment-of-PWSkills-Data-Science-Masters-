    "## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important concepts in linear algebra that are used to solve systems of linear equations and perform operations on matrices. Eigenvalues are a scalar value that represents the scaling factor of an eigenvector when it is multiplied by a matrix. In other words, an eigenvector is a vector that, when multiplied by a matrix, results in a scalar multiple of itself. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are related to the eigen-decomposition approach, which is a method of decomposing a matrix into its constituent eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigen-decomposition approach is a way of expressing a matrix A as a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space in which the matrix A operates, and the eigenvalues represent the scaling factor of each eigenvector. Mathematically, the eigen-decomposition of a matrix A can be written as:\n",
    "## A = VΛV^-1 , where V is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, Λ is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of A, and V^-1 is the inverse of V.\n",
    "## Here's an example to help illustrate these concepts: Suppose we have the following 2x2 matrix A:\n",
    "## A = [2 1]\n",
    "  ##   [1 2]\n",
    "## To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, we start by solving the equation: A - λI = 0 , where λ is the eigenvalue we are trying to find, and I is the identity matrix. This gives us:\n",
    "## [2-λ 1 ] [x] [0]\n",
    "## [1 2-λ] [y] = [0]\n",
    "## Expanding the determinant of the matrix, we get the characteristic equation: (2-λ)(2-λ) - 1 = 0\n",
    "## Simplifying, we get: λ^2 - 4λ + 3 = 0\n",
    "## Solving for λ, we get the eigenvalues: λ1 = 1, λ2 = 3\n",
    "## To find the eigenvectors, we plug each eigenvalue back into the original equation and solve for the corresponding eigenvector. For λ1 = 1, we get:\n",
    "## [1 1] [x] [0]\n",
    "## [1 1] [y] = [0]\n",
    "## Solving for x and y, we get the eigenvector: v1 = [1 -1]\n",
    "## Similarly, for λ2 = 3, we get:\n",
    "## [1 1] [x] [0]\n",
    "## [1 1] [y] = [0]\n",
    "## Solving for x and y, we get the eigenvector: v2 = [1 1]\n",
    "## These eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space in which A operates. Finally, we can express A as a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues using the eigen-decomposition approach: A = VΛV^-1 , where V is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A:\n",
    "## V = [1 1]\n",
    "##  [-1 1]\n",
    "## And Λ is the diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of A:\n",
    "## Λ = [1 0]\n",
    "## [0 3]\n",
    "## So we have: A = VΛV^-1 = [1 1] [1 0] [1 -1]\n",
    "## [0 3] [-1 1]\n",
    "## Simplifying, we get:A = [2 1]\n",
    "##                     [1 2]\n",
    "## which is the original matrix we started with."
